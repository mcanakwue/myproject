1,Introduction

The purpose of the project is to build a binary classification model that can classifier
if an employer can be over or under budget.

2,Required Libraries
Python library used are 
a, pandas
b, Numpy
c, Matplotlip,
d, Sklearn

3,Exploratory Data Analysis
In exploring the data, the linear correlation between dependent and independent variable
was obtain

4,Feature Engineering
The data was cleaned to remove all unneeded special character

5,Model Training and testing
the model was trained with random forest and tested
the accuracy of the model is 54 percent 
which is a low accuracy

6,Tony Shark's Prediction:
Tony shark's data was filtered out to avoid data leakge
after Tony shark's data was used to make prediction using the trained model.
